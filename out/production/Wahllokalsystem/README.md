# Wahllokalsystem

The `Wahllokalsystem` is a system that supports elections in the city of munich. It enables the election board of each constituency to enter the counted votes and deliver them securely to the election office.

The system also allows users to document the presence of the election board and occurences during the election. It has certain offline capabilities in case of a broken network connection and is also able to notify all election offices via broadcast messages.

The system was developed and used for the first time during the Bundestags election september 2017.
