  Sample definitions for restricting the access to the Jolokia agent. Adapt this
  file and copy it over to 'jolokia-access.xml', which get's evaluated during
  runtime (if included in the war).

  You can restrict the available methods in principale as well as the accessible
  attributes and operations in detail.
-->

<restrict>

    <!-- List of remote hosts which are allowed to access this agent. The name can be
         given as IP or FQDN. If any of the given hosts matches, access will be allowed
        (respecting further restrictions, though). If <remote> ... </remote> is given
        without any host no access is allowed at all (probably not what you want).

        You can also specify a subnetmask behind a numeric IP address in which case any
        host within the specified subnet is allowed to access the agent. The netmask can
        be given either in CIDR format (e.g "/16") or as a full netmask (e.g. "/255.255.0.0")
    -->
    <remote>

    <!--
    List of allowed commands.

    If this sections is present, it influence the following section.

    For each command type present, the principle behaviour is allow this command for all
    MBeans. To remove an MBean (attribute/operation), a <deny> section has to be added.

    For each common type missing, the command is disabled by default. For certain MBeans
    it can be selectively by enabled by using an <allow> section below

    Known types are:

    * read
    * write
    * exec
    * list
    * version
    * search

    A missing <commands> section implies that every operation type is allowed (and can
    be selectively controlled by a <deny> section)
    -->

    <commands>
        <command>read</command>
        <command>write</command>
        <command>exec</command>
        <command>list</command>
        <command>version</command>
        <command>search</command>
    </commands>


    <!--
    Restrict access only via the specified methods

    Example which allows only POST requests:
    <http>
      <method>post</method>
    </http>
    -->

    <!--
    Cross origin protection (CORS).

    You can configure which cross origins are given allowance by the browser.
    With strict-checking, the Origin: header can be also be checked on the server side,
    which results in an error if it doesn't match any specified pattern.
    -->

    <!--
        Example which allows access from www.jolokia.org and the domain jmx4perl.org for CORS
        but does also server side check to prevent CSRF attacks:

    <cors>
        <allow-origin>http://www.jolokia.org</allow-origin>
        <allow-origin>*://*.jmx4perl.org</allow-origin>

        <strict-checking/>
    </cors>
    -->

    <!-- For each command type missing in a given <commands> section, for certain MBeans (which
         can be a pattern, too) an command be allowed. Note that an <allow> entry e.g. for reading
         an attribute of an certain MBean has no influence if reading is enabled globally anyway -->
    <allow>

        <!-- Allow for this MBean the attribute "HeapMemoryUsage" for reading and writing, the attribute
             "Verbose" for reading only and the operation "gc". "read", "write" and/or "exec" has to be omitted
              in the <commands> section above.

             Example: ->
        <mbean>
          <name>java.lang:type=Memory</name>
          <attribute>HeapMemoryUsage</attribute>
          <attribute mode="read">Verbose</attribute>
          <operation>gc</operation>
        </mbean>
        <mbean>
          <name>java.lang:type=Threading</name>
          <attribute>ThreadCount</attribute>
        </mbean>
        -->

        <!-- Allow access to the j4p configuration operations, which are needed for proper check_jmx4perl
             operation -->
        <mbean>
            <name>jolokia:type=Config</name>
            <operation>*</operation>
            <attribute>*</attribute>
        </mbean>
        <mbean>
            <name>java.lang:type=Threading</name>
            <operation>findDeadlockedThreads</operation>
        </mbean>
    </allow>

    <!-- MBean access can be restricted by a <deny> section for commands enabled in a <commands> section
         (or when the <commands> section is missing completely in which case all commands are allowed)
    -->
    <deny>
        <mbean>
